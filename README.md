# Learning how to create a GPT Model

Attempting to create a Generative pre-trained transformer model. This will be utilised in Project Athena as a replacement for OpenAI API when complete enough. This is also a great learning experience and will help me satify my interest and curiosity in learning about AI and it's limits.

I will be following a tutorial to start, in order to get a general foundation but plan on adding my own customisation's whether to get a specified outcome, to do it in a way that I understand more or a way I _think_ may be more efficient.

The plan is to initially use a smaller dataset, (Maybe the Shakespeare one) in order get a deeper understanding of how the model works exactly then get new data from various sources to improve the model.

Thing's I have yet to think about:
- How to classify sarcasm and jokes. (Since in Athena, there will be a setting for this)
